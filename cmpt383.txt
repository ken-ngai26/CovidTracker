Topic idea: what will it actually do?

Covid-19 tracker application
Assume the app is on at all time, and no false information inputted. This will not tackle the privacy issue or else it will be hard to implement with a lot of people not installing, false information, usage of GPS, and hiding symptoms. 
	-Check the current news and cases happening in Canada or in the world

	-Be able to track any symptoms you have and get advice on what to do. (A survey style of diagnosis and return possible output such as flu, covid-19, etc)

	-Make tracing the spread quicker for health service
	
	-Create a semi realtime map with how many covid-19 case in the region.

The three programming languages you will use, and (briefly) what will be implemented with each.
	- (React) Typescript	-	Front-End
	- (Flask) Python	- Back-End logic
	- Go - Faster computation Back-End
	- SQLAlchemy database in Flask - Database


The two inter-language communication methods you will use.
	-FFI (Python && Go)
	-Restful API(React && Python)

Deployment technology: Vagrant VM, or Docker containers.

	-Docker containers
